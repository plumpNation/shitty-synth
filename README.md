Synth
=====

Hobby project to learn about oscillators and filters, while experiencing more about the React
and Redux ecosystem.

Also using:
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) for components
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) for state
- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org) for build
- [Stylus](http://stylus-lang.com/) for style

## To run

```
# install all the deps
yarn

# run the watch build and dev server (parcel)
yarn dev
```
